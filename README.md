# Diffusion_Models-Deeplearning.ai-Course

In this repository, I have included all the notebooks covered under the course on Diffusion Models by Deeplearning.ai.

Diffusion Models approach for training and generating new samples is much more stable than GANs and better than previous approaches like variational autoencoders (VAE) and normalizing flows.
