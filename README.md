# Diffusion_Models-Deeplearning.ai-Course

In this repository, I have included all the notebooks covered under the course on Diffusion Models by Deeplearning.ai.

The dataset is available in my kaggle repository: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bajajganesh/sprites-16x16-dataset

Diffusion Models approach for training and generating new samples is much more stable than GANs and better than previous approaches like variational autoencoders (VAE) and normalizing flows.
